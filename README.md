# ResamplingAdjacencyMatrices

## To do

-   [ ] What cool things are people using bootstraps for in the literature
-   [ ] Dive into the literature to find relevant bootstrap procedures.
-   [ ] Plot these procedures in p-value space (some will be super-uniform, some sub-uniform, can we predict where a given procedure will land?)
-   [ ] Can we find a way of exploiting our stability test to make our own bootstrap procedure that beats the others.
